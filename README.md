//R7 Identify the problem you are trying to solve:

In Australia it is difficult to find high quality cooking equipment, most equipment has been cheaply made in China and imported from the same sources. This application seeks to bring Artisan and consumer together with high quality traditional cooking equipment hand made in Japan.

//R8 Why is it a problem that needs solving?
Australia is the fifth fattest nation in the world, nearly two thirds of Australian adults are overweight or obese and almost a quarter of Australian children are the same. Much of the problem is how we regularly cook our foods. Using heavy oils and hydrogenating fats regularly. The reason we cook using heavy oils and hydrogenated fats is because it tastes good. But food can taste excellent without those ingredients if you have access to better cooking methods. This web application is designed to bring hard to source cooking appliances from Japan to everyday consumers by connecting consumers both to a source and with the ability to sell their second hand appliances when upgrading.
